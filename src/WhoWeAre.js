There are many who are homeless, lonely, from divorced homes, or abused. They all need the good news of the Gospel that Jesus loves them and that He offers them salvation. Hence, we need to reach out to children in Haiti. We are an orphanage located principally in Petion Ville Port au Prince the capital of Haiti."</span></h3>
